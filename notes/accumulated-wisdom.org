* Sending signals to a Qt program

When Qt is in its event loop, signals sent to the program will not be
processed until control returns from the event loop to scheme.  For
example, hitting control-c in the terminal fails to abort the program.
These signals get processed when control returns to scheme, so it is a
good idea to start a timer that periodically does so.  (hint: QObject
startTimer on the qapp)
